# Fixing Proclaim for Livestreaming

OBS Studio and capturing Proclaim is currently having some issues that an effective fix has yet to have been found. Each time you put Proclaim in "On Air" mode OBS Studio is not picking it up and capturing the slides. Each time you take Proclaim out of and restart "On Air" mode you will have to do this fix. Follow the instructions below to get the capture for livestreaming.
