# Switching The Computer To COW Internet
For livestreaming, we use the College of Wooster internet as it gives up to 1000/1000 Mbps (gigabit speeds), rather than the Church MCTV speeds of up to 50/5 Mbps. Follow the instructions below to switch the internet.

---
### 1.	Go to the back of room where access points are (next to the left kitchen door, underneath the PTZ camera) and unplug the top grey cable labelled “Church AP” from the ethernet ports on the wall
 - This unplugs the church access point
 
### 2. Get master key from box in copy room
 - The key is labelled “All Interior Doors”
 - The key box passcode is the Wooster area code

### 3. Go to the electrical room in The Meeting Place
 - This is directly to the left right inside the main door to The Meeting Place

### 4. Unplug the green cable labelled “Mackey Hall” from the church network switch
 - This is straight inside the at the back
 - This one is normally the far left cable in the set of four green cables

### 5.	Plug the same cable into the COW switch
 - The COW switch is the bottom most item on the rack
 - Plug into any port on the switch
 
### 6.	Return the master key to the box

### 7. Return to Mackey Hall

### 8.	Plug the white cable labelled “Computer Ethernet” into the top port that was left empty in step 1
