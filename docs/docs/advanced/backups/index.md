# Backup Files Repository

Welcome to the backup files repository page. Here, you can find backups for various components of our system. Below are the details of each backup:

---

- OBS Studio (Streaming Instance): The backup file for OBS Studio's streaming instance, including scene configurations, audio settings, and stream profiles.

- OBS Studio (All Cameras Instance): The backup file for OBS Studio's all cameras instance, which includes scene configurations, audio settings, and stream profiles.

- Router Backup: The backup file for our router's configuration settings, ensuring we can restore the network settings if needed. 

- PTZ Camera Backup: The backup file for the PTZ camera's configuration settings, including presets, pan/tilt/zoom settings, and exposure configurations.

- Passwords Repository Backup: The backup file for our passwords repository, which contains encrypted and secured passwords for various systems and accounts.

Please note that these backup files are stored in our cloud repository for easy access and restoration purposes. They are organized within individual folders based on the following hierarchy: *`Year > Month > Day`*. This structure allows for ease of finding the backups based on the specific date. Appropriate access permissions are granted to authorized personnel only.
