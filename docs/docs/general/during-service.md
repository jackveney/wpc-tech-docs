# During the Service

Instructions for during the service. Run the livestream image according to below, or as you desire.

**When switching the rear camera, try to make sure that it is not showing on the outgoing stream. It moves in a not so fluid motion, so it's better to have it on "Full Proclaim" or one of the Mevo scenes.**
